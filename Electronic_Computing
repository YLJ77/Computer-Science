Unfortunately,the mechanical arm inside of a relay has mass,and therefore can't
move instantly between opened and close states.

A good relay in the 1940's might be able to flick back and forth fifty times in a second.

Today, computers use transistors that are smaller than 50 nanometers in size - for reference, 
a sheet of paper is roughly 100,000 nanometers thick.

They're not only incredibly small, they're super fast - they can switch states millions of times 
per second, and can run for decades.
